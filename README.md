# Crop-Analysis-Recommendation-System-using-Power-BI
Developed an advanced Machine Learning model for a crop analysis and recommendation system for Indian agriculture, seamlessly integrating powerful data visualization through Power BI.

**Overview:-**
This project aimed to develop a farmer-oriented web platform that merged data-driven crop analysis and geographic insights. The platform was designed to tailor crop recommendations by interpreting yield patterns and predicting productivity factors. It evaluated crop suitability based on pesticide use, pH, humidity, and rainfall data, and provided optimized farming methods for diverse soils across India's regions. The ultimate goal was to enhance sustainable food production by empowering farmers with decision-making tools for more efficient agricultural practices.

**Dataset:-**
I sourced two datasets from the Indian Government Portal, focusing on:

- Soil nutrient data (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, fertilizer, and pesticide information)
- Environmental factors (humidity, temperature, rainfall, and seasonal variations)

**Phases:-**

1) Scope & Initial Research: I established project requirements and explored pertinent algorithms while identifying suitable datasets for Indian agriculture.
2) Data Collection & Preparation: I cleaned and analyzed datasets, incorporating relevant climatic factors impacting crop yield.
3) Data Refinement & Dashboard Development: I refined datasets to align with project objectives and developed an initial dashboard for comprehensive analysis.
4) Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization: I conducted thorough data analysis using Jupyter, Seaborn, and Power BI, integrating Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data transformation and visualization.
